AI UTILISATION LEARNING CHECKLIST

1. Understand AI APIs & How They Work



[ ] Research: What is an API? How do AI APIs like OpenAI, Hugging Face work?

[ ] Read code using requests or openai Python libraries.

[ ] Learn to authenticate and send simple prompts.

Mini Project:

[ ] Write a Python script that sends a question to ChatGPT and prints the answer.

[ ] Extend it to log the input and output into a local text file.


---

2. Format and Send Prompts



[ ] Research prompt engineering: clarity, context, instruction-based prompting.

[ ] Study the structure of JSON data received from AI APIs.

Mini Project:

[ ] Build a program that accepts user input, adds a fixed context (e.g., "act like a doctor"), and sends the prompt to the AI.

[ ] Create a script that loops through a list of prompts and saves all responses to a file.


---

3. Process & Refine AI Responses



[ ] Learn basic string manipulation in Python to clean/format AI responses.

[ ] Study how to parse and act on structured responses (e.g., commands, JSON).

Mini Project:

[ ] Ask the AI to return a JSON list of tasks. Parse and display them as a to-do list.

[ ] Build a small assistant that generates code snippets and runs them if they pass safety checks.


---

4. Connect AI to Hardware or External Inputs



[ ] Research AI-assisted decision-making (e.g., AI tells sensor system what to do).

[ ] Read projects combining AI with voice, images, or IoT.

Mini Project:

[ ] Build a Python program where AI interprets sensor data and gives advice (e.g., suggest turning on a fan if temp > 30°C).

[ ] Add voice input using speech_recognition and send it as a prompt to the AI.


---

5. Build an AI-Powered Application



[ ] Study apps that use AI for real use (e.g., chatbots, data analysis).

[ ] Learn simple GUI creation (e.g., tkinter, PyQt, streamlit).

Mini Project:

[ ] Create a chatbot with a simple GUI that talks to OpenAI.

[ ] Build a real-time assistant that takes your notes and rewrites them in professional English.


---

6. (Optional Advanced): Use AI Locally



[ ] Research lightweight models like llama.cpp, gpt4all, or transformers.

[ ] Learn how to run models offline on your PC if you have enough resources.

Mini Project:

[ ] Run a small text-generation model locally and interact with it via terminal.

[ ] Compare its answers to OpenAI’s and analyze the difference.
